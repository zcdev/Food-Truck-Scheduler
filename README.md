# Food-Truck-Tracker

### Overview

In this project, I created a schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. The app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various transportations, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.
